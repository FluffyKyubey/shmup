While Nick here taught you how to shoot he didn’t get the chance to teach you about the weapons overdrive systems. If you hold down the F key you can overload the weapon system to shoot out a large beam. But you can also hit the E key to switch the Beam to a Hyper Overdrive when you finish charging the beam it’ll fire larger normal shots but you will overheat the system's energy and won't be able to charge for a short period of time afterwards.

Worry not recruit when you detach the portable gun it will slowly work its way back to your ship or you can press Q again to make it return to you faster.
